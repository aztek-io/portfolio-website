# About Me

Sr. DevOps Solutions Architect with 10+ years of experience building cloud infrastructure, leading SRE teams, and shipping reliable software at scale.

## Professional Background

I'm a DevOps engineer and engineering leader who thrives on building infrastructure that teams can depend on. From designing Kubernetes clusters and CI/CD pipelines from scratch to leading SRE teams through acquisitions, I bring a hands-on approach combined with strategic thinking.

I've reduced cloud spending by tens of thousands per month, containerized legacy systems, and helped organizations adopt Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, Helm, and modern GitOps practices. I believe in Servant Leadership and building teams that ship with confidence.
