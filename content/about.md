# About Me

Sr. DevOps Solutions Architect with 10+ years of experience building cloud infrastructure, leading SRE teams, and shipping reliable software at scale. I specialize in AI/ML infrastructure, Kubernetes orchestration, and security-first automation.

## Professional Background

I'm a DevOps engineer and engineering leader who thrives on building infrastructure that teams can depend on. From designing AI-powered vulnerability analysis systems with AWS Bedrock to leading SRE teams through acquisitions, I bring a hands-on approach combined with strategic thinking.

I've led SOC2 certification efforts, architected data lakes for CVE intelligence, built AI agent swarms with RAG patterns, and designed IaC strategies from scratch. I've reduced cloud spending by tens of thousands per month while overseeing infrastructure accounting for 25% of revenue with only 5% of cloud spend. I believe in Servant Leadership and building teams that ship with confidence.
